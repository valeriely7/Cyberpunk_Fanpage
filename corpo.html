            <h2>Arasaka</h2>
            <p>The Arasaka Megacorporation is the most well known and the most powerful megacorporation next to Militech. Founded in 1915 by Sasai Arasaka, the Arasaka megacorporation is well known for their corporate security, banking and manufacturing. Arasaka Mega Corporation is also the largest distributor in the whole world, delivering Japanese-made goods throughout the market. They are also a megacorporation to be feared, as they also have a reputation for having their own army and many loyal followers, ready to be used and disposed of when necessary. The current head of the megacorporation in recent years is Saburo Arasaka, a proud and honorable man who above all else, is a tyrant. Now turning 158 in the year 2077, Saburo Arasakas thirst for power is still as strong as ever. </p>
