            <h2>Arasaka</h2>
            <p>The Arasaka Megacorporation is the most well known and the most powerful megacorporation next to Militech. Founded in 1915 by Sasai Arasaka, the Arasaka megacorporation is well known for their corporate security, banking and manufacturing. Arasaka Mega Corporation is also the largest distributor in the whole world, delivering Japanese-made goods throughout the market. They are also a megacorporation to be feared, as they also have a reputation for having their own army and many loyal followers, ready to be used and disposed of when necessary. The current head of the megacorporation in recent years is Saburo Arasaka, a proud and honorable man who above all else, is a tyrant. Now turning 158 in the year 2077, Saburo Arasakas thirst for power is still as strong as ever. </p>

            <h2>Militech</h2>
            <p>A megacorporation founded in 1996 by Antonio Luccessi, Militech International Armaments or just Militech for short, is one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers and also well known for private military contracting. Unlike the Arasaka Megacorporation, Militech was founded in the New United States, and its sole purpose is to focus on the manufacturing of weapons to fuel the war machine of its country or those who offer the highest bidding for its services. Militech also has their own army and group of loyal employees ready to die for Militechs cause. Militech also has a rivalry with Arasaka Megacorporation, to the point where they have gone to war with each other and almost caused a global economic collapse, an event called the 4th corporate war.</p>
