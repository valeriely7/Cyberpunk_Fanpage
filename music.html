            <h2>Who are the Samurai?</h2>
            <p>An anti-establishment band in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. Founded by characters Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne, the band's genre is considered chromatic rock, a style of music influenced mainly from Metal and Punk Rock. Samurai's name came from fellow band member Nancy Hartley after using the term “samurai” as a form of mockery, inspired by the fact that samurai used to die for any cause no matter how morally wrong it was. Samurai eventually broke up after the band members split due to different creative directions. Samurai fits the themes of the world of cyberpunk due to the dystopian nature of the setting, and the fight against the corruption of the corporations that affect the characters and influence the world. The lyrics reflect the feelings of someone fighting against the corruption and restraints of the mega corporations, something that Johnny Silverhand experienced and can relate to.</p>

            <h2>How did Samurai Start?</h2>
            <p>Samurai was started by rockerboy and terrorist Johnny Silverhand and fellow band member Kerry Eurodyne. Silverhand helped found Samurai after deserting the U.S Army due to the massive amount of corruption he witnessed from the megacorporations, as well as losing his arm and an old comrade that saved his life. All of his feelings and thoughts are reflected well in his music. Silverhands style of music as well as Samurais is labeled as chromatic rock in the game, a style of music that is heavily influenced by the instrumental sounds Metal and the screaming vocals Punk Rock. Johnny Silverhand is portrayed by actor Keanu Reeves in both voice acting and motion capture with the exception of being the vocalist behind Samurai music, a role which is covered by Dennis Lyxzen of the hit band Refused.</p>
