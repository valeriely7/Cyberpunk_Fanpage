            <h2>What is Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
            <p>"Cyberpunk 2077" is a narrative-driven RPG game developed and published by CD Projekt Red. Set in the dystopian world, "Night City" is a place filled with disparity where the mega corporations holds immense power, and society is divided by the ultra-rich and the oppressed masses. Night City is a hub of cybernetics where individuals often "chrome" themselves. In other words, citizens often augment themselves to either upgrade for more power or to simply just change their appearance. However, this can come at a great cost as chroming yourself can lead to high levels of violence and cosmetic addictions. The city constantly suffers from gang violence and corporate warfare. "Cyberpunk 2077" vividly captures the harsh reality of these conflicts, immersing players in a world where danger lurks around every corner. </p>
