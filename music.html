            <h2>Who are the Samurai?</h2>
            <p>An anti-establishment band in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. Founded by characters Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne, the band's genre is considered chromatic rock, a style of music influenced mainly from Metal and Punk Rock. Samurai's name came from fellow band member Nancy Hartley after using the term “samurai” as a form of mockery, inspired by the fact that samurai used to die for any cause no matter how morally wrong it was. Samurai eventually broke up after the band members split due to different creative directions. Samurai fits the themes of the world of cyberpunk due to the dystopian nature of the setting, and the fight against the corruption of the corporations that affect the characters and influence the world. The lyrics reflect the feelings of someone fighting against the corruption and restraints of the mega corporations, something that Johnny Silverhand experienced and can relate to.</p>
